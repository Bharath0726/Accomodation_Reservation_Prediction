# Accomodation_Reservation_Prediction

# Accommodation Reservation Prediction

## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts hotel booking cancellations by analyzing various factors such as booking details, customer profiles, and hotel properties. The solution helps accommodation providers optimize their inventory management and revenue by anticipating cancellations before they occur.

## Project Architecture
The project follows MLOps best practices with a modular pipeline architecture:
